A front-end game, built with vanilla JavaScript. 
This is a short term memory based game with simple rules.
In every round, a new random button gets activated, which the player must remember. 
The player has to click all of the correct buttons in the correct sequence to proceed to the next round. 
For example, if the player is in the beginning of the 5th round, they'll have to select the 5 buttons the program has
randomly selected in the correct order. The player will then proceed to the next round.
As far as the rounds go, there's no limit, but you might be able to impress yourself with your short term memory ;)
